# Qest-front-utils

`This package has 3 peer dependencies: react, react-dom, antd. We cant have them as direct dependencies, because we would introduce different versions of these packages into the project, which would break react itself.`

[formGenerator](./formGenerator/README) - Util that creates basic formik form from Object definition.  
[Map](./Map/README) - Basic component, that iterates over object or array and provides typed renderProps.
